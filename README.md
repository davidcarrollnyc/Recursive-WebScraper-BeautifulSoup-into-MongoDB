This is a PYTHON/MySQL User Registration/Login system which employs:

MySQL
FLASK-SQLAlchemy

Hosted on HEROKU - please note that my Username, Password and DB Name have been replaced with XXXXXXXXX's and you will have to provide your own in order to implement the solution.

Naturally, the connection and hosting parameters can be modified to suit.

The key element here is implementing the Flask-SQLAlchemy package.

The system can easily be extended to build out a more functional menu system with authorized access and further security etc.

The Procfile is required by HEROKU to direct the server the to start of the app
